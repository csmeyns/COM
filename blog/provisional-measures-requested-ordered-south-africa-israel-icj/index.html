		<p>On 29 December 2023, the steadfast and courageous Republic of South Africa filed a case with the International Court of Justice (ICJ) against &ldquo;The State of Israel&rdquo; on suspicion of genocidal intent. South Africa requested a number of provisional measures while genocide is being investigated. On 26 January 2024 the ICJ delivered its order against &ldquo;The State of Israel&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As there has been some kerfuffle about what the ICJ&rsquo;s order really amounts to, and how close it is to what the South African legal team had requested, here&rsquo;s a tabular comparison of the two sets of provisional measures for easy comparison, with the differences pointed out.</p>
<h2 id="provisional-measures">Provisional measures</h2>
<p>To distinguish internal cross-references between the two sets of provisional measures, numbers of the provisional measures requested by the Republic of South Africa are prefixed with an <code>[SA]</code>, while numbers of provisional measures ordered by the Court are prefixed with an <code>[ICJ]</code>.</p>

     <li id="fn-4"><a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/convention-prevention-and-punishment-crime-genocide">Article II of the Genocide Convention</a> reads: "In the present Convention, genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: (a) Killing members of the group; (b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; (c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group." <a href="#fn-4-ref" aria-label="Return to footnote 4 referring content.">↩︎</a></li>
     <li id="fn-5">South Africa had requested, more strongly, that (<b>[SA]1</b>) "Israel" immediately suspend its military operations in and against Gaza, and (<b>[SA]2</b>) that military or irregular armed units, persons or organizations directed, supported, or influenced by "Israel" or subject to its control "take no steps in furtherance of the military operations" in and against Gaza. If a military, military units, irregular armed united, people or organizations, halt all its activities, then it follows that it also cannot commit any acts that fall within Article II of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. Hence, the ICJ has ordered something weaker than South Africa had requested. <a href="#fn-5-ref" aria-label="Return to footnote 5 referring content.">↩︎</a></li>
     <li id="fn-6">South Africa had requested (in <b>[SA]6.</b>), more specifically, that the State of Israel ensure that its military, any irregular armed units or individuals which may be directed, supported or otherwise influenced by it and any organizations and persons which may be subject to its control, direction or influence, do not engage in direct and public incitement to commit genocide, plus that it ensure that these don't engage in "conspiracy to commit genocide, attempt to commit genocide, or complicity in genocide, and insofar as they do engage therein, that steps are taken towards their punishment". In the ICJ's order, this is formulated as the weaker "take all measures within its power to prevent", while the focus shifts to incitement, and away from conspiracy or attempt to commit, or complicity in, genocide. Moreover, the ICJ's order omits reference to the punishment of such acts. <a href="#fn-6-ref" aria-label="Return to footnote 6 referring content.">↩︎</a></li>
     <li id="fn-7"><a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/convention-prevention-and-punishment-crime-genocide">Article III of the Genocide Convention</a> reads: "The following acts shall be punishable: (a) Genocide; (b) Conspiracy to commit genocide; (c) Direct and public incitement to commit genocide; (d) Attempt to commit genocide; (e) Complicity in genocide." <a href="#fn-7-ref" aria-label="Return to footnote 7 referring content.">↩︎</a></li>
