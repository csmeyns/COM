At the start of the pandemic of 2020, facial recognition systems were momentarily thrown into disarray. How to identify faces, if everyone venturing outside covers mouths and noses with virus-repellent cloth?1
That these machine learning systems could soon make do with simply people’s eyes and facial shape is, to me, telling, not just because of the nauseating extent of continued on- and offline surveillance it reveals.</description></item><item><title>Amo and Molyneux’s Question</title><link>https://www.chrismeyns.xyz/blog/2020-01-01-amo-molyneux/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.chrismeyns.xyz/blog/2020-01-01-amo-molyneux/</guid><description>An article that discusses what the philosopher Anton Amo (ca. 1703–ca. 1750) plausibly might have said, had they considered questions about cross-modal learning</description></item><item><title>Inscription Rebellion on Elizabeth Carter’s (1717-1806) Title Page</title><link>https://www.chrismeyns.xyz/blog/2019-06-03-inscription-rebellion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jun 2019 20:35:18 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.chrismeyns.xyz/blog/2019-06-03-inscription-rebellion/</guid><description>In 1758, a revolutionary text left London-based printer S.
