      <description>On 29 December 2023, the steadfast and courageous Republic of South Africa filed a case with the International Court of Justice (ICJ) against &amp;ldquo;The State of Israel&amp;rdquo; on suspicion of genocidal intent. South Africa requested a number of provisional measures while genocide is being investigated. On 26 January 2024 the ICJ delivered its order against &amp;ldquo;The State of Israel&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;As there has been some kerfuffle about what the ICJ&amp;rsquo;s order really amounts to, and how close it is to what the South African legal team had requested, here&amp;rsquo;s a tabular comparison of the two sets of provisional measures for easy comparison, with the differences pointed out.</description>

      <description>This is an audio recording and accompanying transcript of part of a programme of speeches delivered as part of the climate march (klimaatmars) held in Amsterdam on 12 November 2023.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m providing this here because:&#xA;In the official broadcast the presenters talked over, and so blocked out, parts of the speeches. Those missing parts are included here. The current recording will allow you to get a better sense of the surface-level aggression and booing that were tangible on the ground.</description>
